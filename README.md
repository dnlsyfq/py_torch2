# PyTorch
build a network and run data forward through it. After that, define a loss and an optimization method to train the neural network on a dataset of handwritten digits. test that network ability to generalize through **validation**.

---

**Autograd**
* to calculate gradients for training neural networks
* does all the work of backpropagation for you by calculating the gradients at each operation in the network which you can then use to update the network weights.

**Transfer Learning**
Network may not work too well with more complex images. Therefore use pre-trained networks to improve the performance of your classifier with TL
